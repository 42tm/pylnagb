pylnagb
=======

`pylnagb` is a Python module that provides Linear Algebra operations, mainly
those for vectors and matrices. We also hope that we will be able to implement
graphing functions and displaying graphs of linear equations via any of several
GUI modules out there.

Background
----------

This module was created to learn how Linear Algebra operations can be expressed
in programming, and it is intended for educational purposes rather than
software production. Several Linear Algebra modules have already been made for
Python, the one being the most general-purpose is NumPy's `linalg`.

License
-------

As stated above, the module is intended for educational purposes, and that's
why we believe it is best to release `pylnagb` into the Public Domain.
